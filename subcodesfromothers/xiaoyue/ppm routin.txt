Hello Scott,

   In step_ch_para.c I changed both the time and spacial interpolation to 4-th order. 

   For parabolic interpolation, in decs.h something should be changed.

   1. NGhost=3 (so all zone-centered-variables' arrays change to [NX+2*NGhost][NP] form, in linear case NGhost=2)

   2. add global variables 
      extern double a_Ip_l[NX+2*NGhost][NP]
      extern double a_Ip_r[NX+2*NGhost][NP]

   3. add statement for subroutine para()
      void para(double x1, double x2, double x3, double x4, double x5, double *lout, double *rout)

  If you have and problem with this please tell me! Have fun! =)

Best,
Xiaoyue
